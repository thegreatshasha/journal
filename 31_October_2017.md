# Thinking Walks
* Discrete grid tracking for formulating joint probabilistic data association. Start thinking about this formulation.
* Meet Sandeep
  * Computer vision cell
  * Hackathon
  * Grad school
  * Surya ganguly paper discussion for shape problem.
* Gaussian processes for solving the shape problem.
* Adversarial tracking with linear latent variables. Latent variables should be linearly additive.
* Semantic flow should have the latent linear additive property.

# Agenda
* Write paper.
* Stare at old tracking results.
* GRE.???
* Reimplement kalman tracker in python for same matlab example.
* Export centers.
* Throw kalman tracker at the beetles problem.
* Meet people from jitu lab, ladhar lab. Understand the sort of computer vision problems they work on.
* Meet Sahil fr data hack.
* Discrete formulation of tracking (ghostbusters example) with pencil and paper.
* Read graphical models section1&2 from bishop tand present to amit.
* SSD chalktalk.
* JPDA chalktalk. Should be pretty useful for local computer vision problems.
* Gaussian mixture model chalk discussion.
* Play around with picture.
* Talk on ghostbusters tracking.
